          appearance. Each element, from the color of a simple widget to the
          backdrop, exudes its own personality. Throughout its development, Zimo
          Web has showcased a variety of themes, which can be directly

          <SectionTextTitle>Use of Colors</SectionTextTitle>
          Zimo Web utilizes a meticulously selected palette of colors to enrich
          its content and overall design. Embracing a minimalist design
          philosophy, it restricts its color selection to a handful of choices:
          four primary accent hues and two special applications. This palette
          forms the foundation of Zimo Web{"\u2019"}s thematic color
          combinations.

        <TextBox>
          <SectionTextTitle>Transparency</SectionTextTitle>
          Most of Zimo Web{"\u2019"}s themes employ transparency to achieve a
          modern, simplistic, and layered design philosophy. Despite general
          conventions, some themes that embrace flat design choose to forego
          transparency and use opaque layers for visual elements instead.
          However, the translucent art style remains Zimo Web{"\u2019"}s primary
          design style for most themes.
          <SectionTextTitle className="mt-6">Text Box</SectionTextTitle>
          While most text elements on Zimo Web are displayed in the four primary
          tones, these texts are often encased in translucent, rounded-corner
          containers with a blur effect to stand out against the background.
          These containers use the widget special color for their backdrop,
          serving as the primary means to hold text and differentiate it from
          the contrasting and rich background. This design feature is a
          ubiquitous element throughout the site, providing a consistent and
          distinctive visual theme.
          <SectionTextTitle className="mt-6">
            Widgets and Window
          </SectionTextTitle>
          Aside from text boxes, the same design philosophy is applied to most
          widgets that Zimo Web uses for its functionalities. Although they vary
          slightly, nearly all widgets align visually with each other, achieving
          a coherent design palette across the site. Widgets are present
          throughout Zimo Web and are prominently featured in its window
          framework, where users can easily interact with widgets of all types.

          <SectionTextTitle>Favicon</SectionTextTitle>
          Zimo Web maintains a consistent identity, particularly reflected in
          its design of favicons. The favicon of Zimo Web features a simple
          circular pattern, but each theme gives it a unique coloring and feel.
          In addition to the signature favicon, which showcases three distinct
          color schemes, there are many others, each with its own distinct
          personality.

          Zimo Web employs diverse backgrounds to enhance the browsing
          experience. They often adopt a specific color or object as a theme and
          expand on it with a range of vector graphics, complementing the theme
          {"\u2019"}s color palette. Many themes feature animated backgrounds;
          the masterfully designed animations add to the satisfaction of the
